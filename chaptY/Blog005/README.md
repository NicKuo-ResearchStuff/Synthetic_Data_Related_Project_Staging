Hey, hello, and Kia Ora!

In the previous posts (see [this](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Synthetic_Data_Related_Project_Staging/tree/main/chaptY/Blog001) and [this](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Synthetic_Data_Related_Project_Staging/tree/main/chaptY/Blog002)), we introduced PRIME-CVD Data Asset 1 as a clean, analysis-ready cohort and documented its baseline characteristics.
In this post, we step back and answer a different question:</br>
Where did this dataset actually come from?

This post explains what we chose to encode, and why those decisions matter for teaching.

## A Design Constraint from the Start

PRIME-CVD Data Asset 1 was designed under three non-negotiable constraints:

1. No patient-level data</br>
   No EMR extracts, no registries, no training on real trajectories.

2. Only openly available sources</br>
   Government statistics, surveillance summaries, and published epidemiologic estimates.

3. Pedagogic sufficiency, not maximal realism</br>
   The dataset must be good enough to teach reasoning, not to mirror every nuance of reality.

This immediately rules out many popular approaches to “synthetic EMR”,</br>
*i.e., data generated using AI/ML techniques which learn directly from real patient data,</br>*
and forces a different design philosophy.

## Encoded Causal Relationships and Public Evidence

PRIME-CVD Data Asset 1 is generated from a hand-specified causal DAG. Each edge below is supported by openly available population statistics or epidemiologic literature.

## The Minimal Desiderata We Enforced

When designing Data Asset 1, we asked a small number of concrete questions.
1. Can students recognise the population?
2. Do stratifications reveal structure?
3. Do models behave sensibly?

If a feature did not support at least one of these goals, it was excluded.

---

## Closing Notes

PRIME-CVD Data Asset 1 is not a replica of reality.

It is a distillation:

* of what we know publicly,
* of what we can justify pedagogically,
* and of what students must understand before they confront real EMR data.
