# About Masked Clinical Modelling (MCM)

Masked Clinical Modelling (MCM) [1, 2] is a research framework developed at the  
Centre for Big Data Research in Health (CBDRH), UNSW Sydney, extending the  
[Health Gym](https://github.com/NicKuo-ResearchStuff/Health_Gym_AI) initiative.

It introduces a BERT-inspired generative framework for creating and augmenting survival analysis datasets,  
balancing data realism with clinical utility — ensuring that models trained on synthetic data  
preserve key survival metrics such as hazard ratios and calibration.

* What it provides: a flexible modelling pipeline for conditional synthesis and augmented survival data generation.
* What it improves: downstream CoxPH discrimination (C-index) and calibration consistency.
* What it enables: privacy-preserving, subgroup-targeted data generation for equitable model training.

**Highlights of MCM**

* Dual-purpose framework: supports both standalone synthetic data generation and targeted augmentation.
* Utility-oriented: preserves clinical interpretability (hazard ratios, calibration slopes).
* Attention-guided architecture: predicts masked clinical features using contextual cues.
* Evaluation-ready: seamlessly integrates with standard survival models (*e.g.,* CoxPH).
* Open science: fully reproducible notebooks and Colab links for demonstration and benchmarking.

**Methodology Overview**

* Masking Phase: randomly hide a subset of clinical features (*e.g.,* age, SBP, AF, CHF).
* Attention Phase: an Attention Filter (AF) identifies relevant observed features for reconstruction.
* Reconstruction Phase: a two-layer MLP predicts the missing values, minimising MSE.

This mechanism allows MCM to:
- Impute incomplete clinical records,
- Synthesise new virtual patients, and
- Augment minority subgroups for improved risk model calibration.
